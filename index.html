        <p><h1>Computer programming</h1>
        Computer programming is designing and building executable programs to solve specific tasks. It includes analysis, algorithm design, implementation in a programming language, and ensuring algorithms are accurate and efficient. The goal is to 
        automate tasks on a computer. Programming requires expertise in various areas such 
        as the domain application, algorithms, and logic.

        <h2 id="H">History</h2>
        Programmable devices date back to 1206 with Al-Jazari's automata. The first computer program was created by Ada Lovelace in 1843, an algorithm for calculating <br>
        Bernoulli numbers. Women dominated programming until the mid-1960s.<br>
        In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith introduced machine-readable data. The concept of <br>
        stored-program computers appeared in 1949.<br>
        Early programs were written in machine code. Assembly languages, developed later, <br>
        allowed more readable text-based instructions. Kathleen Booth created one of the <br>
        first assembly languages in 1950.
        <h2 id="MP">Modern programming</h2>
        Reliability: How often a program produces correct results, considering conceptual <br>
        accuracy and minimization of errors.<br>
        Usability: How easy a program is to use, often determining its success.<br>
        Portability: Ability to run on different hardware and operating systems.<br>
        Maintainability: Ease of modifying the program for improvements or fixes.<br>
        Efficiency: Measure of resource consumption like processor time and memory space.
        <h3 id="QR">Quality requirements</h3>
        Programs must satisfy fundamental properties like reliability, usability, portability, and efficiency.
        <h3 id="RSC">Readability of source code</h3>
        Readability refers to how easily a human can understand and modify source code. <br>
        Unreadable code leads to bugs and inefficiencies.
        <h3 id="CA">Chess algorithms</h3>
        The 1950 "minimax" algorithm paper influenced algorithmic complexity. Chess programs, like IBM's Deep Blue, are studied in computer science.
        <h2 id="PL">Programming languages</h2>
        Languages differ in paradigms and are chosen based on task suitability, team <br>
        expertise, and other factors. Low-level languages are machine-oriented; highlevel languages are abstract but easier to use.
        <h2 id="P">Programmers</h2>
        Programmers perform tasks such as coding, debugging, documentation, and testing. <br>
        They are responsible for various aspects of software development, including <br>
        maintenance and architecture.
